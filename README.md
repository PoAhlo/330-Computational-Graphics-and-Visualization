# CS-330 Computational Graphics and Visualization

### Software design approach
#### What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
The project forced me to plan out what I wanted to do before doing it, something I will admit I did not do much prior to this class.

#### What design process did you follow for your project work?
Prior to creating anything, I sketched a diagram of what I was looking to do.  This planning helped make adjusting the model very straightforward.

I broke everything down into steps.  For each object I needed to create the vertex, normal, and texture coordinate arrays and make vertex buffer objects for these arrays, then I needed to select a texture, followed by making a model matrix for that object.  Then, in the main while loop, I could bind the buffers, assign the texture, and draw the object.  

#### How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
The biggest takeaway is the planning phase of my design approach.  I used to jump into problems blindly, relying on my ability to adapt and adjust.  Now, I have learned to sit and truly understand what I want to do before executing - a tactic that will definitely benefit my work.


### Program Development Approach
#### What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I didn't quite use new development strategies.  Instead, I greatly improved some, such as documenting and organizing my code.

#### How did iteration factor into your development?
There was a lot of repetitive code, but to keep things consistent and simple I opted out of using for loops or other iterative structures to make models, draw, make buffers, etc.

#### How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
At the beginning, I felt like I was only copying other people's code and not understanding what I was doing.  As time passed, I got a better grasp on the concepts, and I could write my own code and understand why I did things the way I did.


### CS and My Goals
#### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational and professional pathway?
There are some transferable skills that I learned, such as the planning, documentation, and organization skills that I meantion earlier in this document.  These skills are applicable to both my career and my educational journey, as both will present more opportunities to code more and apply these skills.
